# It's just a phase! - your daily Moon Phase Tracker

"It's just a phase!" is a simple online tool that allows you to track the Moon Cycle. It displays the current Moon Phase alongside its image and detailed description. Additionally, it offers other relevant information such as the approximate distance between the Moon and Earth, the percentage of the Moon that is currently visible, the number of days until the next Full Moon etc., all of which are updated daily. The website also explains how the Moon Cycle works; it lists and describes all phases of the Moon. Finally, it showcases the changes in the Moon's surface throughout the cycle with a small photo gallery. The site is composed of four pages: Current Moon Phase, Moon Cycle Explained, FAQ, and Gallery.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme of "It's just a phase!" Moon Cycle Tracker was generated from its background picture, which captures the beauty of a night, starry sky. Because it plays a crucial role in setting the tone and atmosphere of the app, I wanted to keep it simple and elegant by introducing the classic combination of black and white, alongside a few subtle shades of blue and grey to emphasize a connection to the astronomical theme. The strongest colour accent of the website is a mid-toned, golden ochre shade called buff, which refers to the colour of natural, undyed leather. I believe it provides a nice contrast to the darker shades, adding a touch of warmth and balance to the overall colour scheme.

I used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/777777-d39b5b-ffffff-606e97-2e3451-04030e) to generate my colour palette.

### Typography

The combination of well-matching Playfair Display and Quattrocento fonts was suggested by one of the font pairing services called [fontpair.co](https://www.fontpair.co/). These fonts create a great contrast in a harmonising way. They enhance the visual hierarchy of the website and highlight essential information.

- The [Playfair Display](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playfair+Display?query=playfair) font is well-suited for titling and headlines, which makes it a perfect choice for the website's main logo and sections' headings. It's eye-catching, sophisticated and it easily draws attention

- The [Quattrocento](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Quattrocento?query=quattro) font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Serif as the fallback font. It's a classic and elegant typeface that ensures easy readability. It was mainly used to provide text content to the paragraphs.

[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons were used for social media links in the footer.
