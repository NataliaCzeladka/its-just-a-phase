                <h2>What are the Moon Phases?</h2>
                    <p>If you have looked into the night sky, you may have noticed the Moon appears to change shape each night. 
                    Some nights, the Moon might look like a narrow crescent. Other nights, the Moon might look like a bright circle. 
                    And on other nights, you might not be able to see the Moon at all. 
                    The different shapes of the Moon that we see at different times of the month are called the Moon Phases.</p>
                <h2>Why does this happen?</h2>
                    <p>The shape of the Moon isn’t changing throughout the month. However, our view of the Moon does change. 
                    The Moon does not produce its own light. There is only one source of light in our solar system, and that is the Sun. 
                    Without the Sun, our Moon would be completely dark. What you may have heard referred to as “moonlight” is actually just sunlight reflecting off of the Moon’s surface.
                    The Sun’s light comes from one direction, and it always illuminates, or lights up, one half of the Moon – the side of the Moon that is facing the Sun. The other side of the Moon is dark. The Moon displays these phases one after the other as it moves through its cycle each month.</p>

                <h2>The Eight Moon Phases</h2>
                    <p>🌑 New Moon: We can't see the Moon when it's a new moon.</p>
                    <p>🌒 Waxing Crescent: In the Northern Hemisphere, we see the waxing crescent phase as a thin crescent of light on the right.</p>
                    <p>🌓 First Quarter: We see the first quarter phase as a half moon.</p>
                    <p>🌔 Waxing Gibbous: The waxing gibbous phase is between a half moon and full moon. Waxing means it is getting bigger.</p>
                    <p>🌕 Full Moon: We can see the Moon completely illuminated during full moons.</p>
                    <p>🌖 Waning Gibbous: The waning gibbous phase is between a full moon and a half moon. Waning means it is getting smaller.</p>
                    <p>🌗 Third Quarter: We see the third quarter moon as a half moon, too. It is the opposite half as illuminated in the first quarter moon.</p>
                    <p>🌘 Waning Crescent: In the Northern Hemisphere, we see the waning crescent phase as a thin crescent of light on the left.</p>
