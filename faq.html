                <h2>Are Moon Phases the same everywhere on Earth?</h2>
                    <p>Yes, everyone sees the same phases of the Moon. People north and south of the equator do see the Moon’s current phase from different angles, though. 
                    If you traveled to the other hemisphere, the Moon would be in the same phase as it is at home, but it would appear upside down compared to what you're used to! 
                    For example, on March 8, 2021, the Moon was in a waning crescent phase (look at the picture below). Seen from the Northern Hemisphere, the waning crescent appeared on the left side of the Moon. 
                    Seen from the Southern Hemisphere, the crescent appeared on the right.</p>

            <div class="outer moon-cycle">
                <h2>How is a New Moon different from a lunar eclipse?</h2>
                    <p>A new moon occurs when the Moon is placed between the Sun and Earth such that the side illuminated by the Sun faces away from us. The Moon is still there. We just can’t see it.
                        This is one of the phases of the Moon that occurs with every orbit around the Earth with a periodicity of 29 days, i.e. a new moon happens every month.</p>
                    <p>A lunar eclipse, on the other hand, can only happen during the full moon phase, when the Sun is shining on the side of the Moon facing Earth.
                        The eclipse occurs when Earth moves in between the Moon and the Sun, blocking any of Sun’s light from reaching the Moon.
                        The cause of a lunar eclipse is the alignment of the inclination of the lunar orbital plane around Earth with that of Earth’s orbital plane around the Sun. It is not periodic but lunar eclipses do happen regularly.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="outer moon-cycle">
                <h2>How long does it take the Moon to complete one full cycle of phases?</h2>
                <p>The Moon completes an orbit around the Earth in 27.3 days.
                    However, it takes 29.5 days for a complete lunation, which is the period between two new moons.</p>
                <p>These two measures represent the <i>sidereal</i> and <i>synodic</i> months. The sidereal month is the time it takes the moon to go around the Earth, i.e. 27.3(ish) days.
                    The synodic month acknowledges that during those 27.3 days, the Earth has also been travelling around the Sun. This creates an extra bit of distance the Moon needs to cover to get back to appearing ‘new’ from our perspective. 
                    The time needed to cover that extra distance is about 2.2 days, making a total of 29.5 days between two new moons.</p>
                <p>On average, every 2.7 calendar years, there is a month which has two full moons in it. The second full moon in the same month is known as a <i>blue moon</i>, so the expression ‘once in a blue moon’ means about once every three years or so – if taken literally.</p>
